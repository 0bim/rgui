*OLD PROJECT* 

Only wrote this because I wanted things done a ceratain way at the time. 
Was used for a custom spotfiy overlay and external injectable mods to existing programs.

The built in custom renderer is not that good because it was built to be used with a rendering API I reversed from the program I used this on.

dependencies:
[STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) | [freetype](https://github.com/freetype/freetype) (optional, not implemented in this, might add the use example later)
